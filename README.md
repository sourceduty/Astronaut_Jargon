[Astronaut Jargon](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZU9RDeWWx-astronaut-jargon) transforms everyday language into the professional lingo used by astronauts. It's designed to make your statements sound as if they're being communicated by an experienced space traveler. Whether you're interested in sounding like an astronaut from the early days of space exploration or like one involved in modern missions like the Artemis program, this tool helps you navigate and employ space-related terminology with precision and flair. It's a fun and engaging way to explore the vastness of astronautic communication.

### Example Usage

Channeling the spirit of 1969, the epoch of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, here’s how an astronaut might articulate a simple task like taking a photograph of Earth from lunar orbit:

"Initiating capture sequence of Terra imagery as we orbit the lunar surface. The Hasselblad is secured and set for high-resolution shots. Adjusting the focal settings to compensate for the stark luminosity contrast between Earthshine and the surrounding cosmic void. This will ensure we preserve the vivid azure hues of Earth's hydrosphere and the diverse terrestrial landscapes visible from our current apogee. Over."

Here's an example of how astronaut jargon might sound in the context of NASA's Artemis program:

"Roger, Artemis Control, this is Lunar Module Eagle II on final descent trajectory. We are T-minus 10 minutes to touch down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin. All systems are green, conducting final check on descent propulsion system and cross-referencing with onboard LIDAR for terrain mapping. Anticipating a nominal landing, over."

Here’s a humorous sci-fi example set in the Artemis Program era, 2024:

Original Text:
"Imagine if astronauts could order pizza to the Moon. They’d have to tip the delivery spacecraft generously for such a long journey!"

Converted into 2024 Artemis Program Astronaut Jargon:
"Envision a scenario wherein lunar crewmembers requisition a thermostabilized pizza via a transorbital delivery module. Compensation for the courier spacecraft would necessitate a substantial gratuity, commensurate with the extended trajectory to our celestial neighbor!"
